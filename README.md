Aspiring Security Operations Analyst documenting hands-on learning in Blue Team concepts, networking fundamentals, and SOC-style incident analysis using TryHackMe and the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.

## Contents
- Networking fundamentals
- Incident reports

## Purpose
This repository demonstrates my practical understanding of entry-level Security Operations workflows and foundational cybersecurity concepts as I progress through structured training and hands-on labs.

## My Understanding
Networking is critical in cybersecurity because many attacks originate or are detected through network activity. As a Security Operations Analyst, understanding IP addressing, network traffic, and basic protocols helps identify suspicious behavior, investigate incidents, and support effective threat detection.
