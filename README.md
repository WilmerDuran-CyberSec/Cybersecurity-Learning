Aspiring Security Operations Analyst documenting hands-on learning in Blue Team concepts, networking fundamentals, and SOC-style incident analysis with TryHackMe and the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.
## Contents
* Networking fundamentals
* Incident reports
* SOC-focused documentation
## Purpose
This repository shows my practical understanding of entry-level Security Operations workflows and foundational cybersecurity concepts as I progress through structured training and hands-on labs.
## My Understanding
Networking is critical in cybersecurity because many attacks originate or are detected through network activity. As a Security Operations Analyst, understanding IP addressing, network traffic, and basic protocols enables the identification of suspicious behavior, investigation of incidents, and support for effective threat detection.
