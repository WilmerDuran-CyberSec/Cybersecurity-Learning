# Networking Basics – TryHackMe

## Overview
This document summarizes fundamental networking concepts learned in the TryHackMe "What is Networking" room, with a focus on Security Operations and Blue Team relevance.

## What is a Network
A network is a collection of connected devices that communicate with each other to share data and resources.

## Internet vs Private Networks
- Internet is a global public network.
- Private networks are used inside homes and organizations.

## IP Addresses
- Identify devices on a network.
- Public IPs communicate with the internet.
- Private IPs are used internally.

## MAC Addresses
- Unique hardware identifier.
- Can be spoofed, which poses security risks.

## Spoofing
MAC spoofing allows attackers to impersonate legitimate devices on a network.

## Ping and ICMP
Ping uses ICMP to test connectivity and response time between devices.

## SOC Relevance
Understanding networking fundamentals helps Security Operations Analysts detect suspicious traffic, unauthorized devices, and potential attacks.
